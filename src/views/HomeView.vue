      Welcome to my newest portfolio addition. It's a work in progress but the end goal is to have
      my own design system.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll consider it finished when I have plenty of customizable, accessible, documented
      components.
    </p>
    <p>They will be unit tested with Vitest and end to end tested with Nightwatch.</p>
    <p>
      I might also add in internationalization for French but I'm not fluent, so if you see any
      errors don't hesitate to point them out!
